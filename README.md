# 🔷 Recursive Diamond Pattern – C++ Project

This program prints a perfectly symmetrical diamond made of asterisks (`*`)
using **recursion instead of loops to control row progression**.

It was built as a recursion-focused assignment to strengthen understanding of:

- Base cases in recursive functions  
- Recursive pattern construction  
- Output symmetry and spacing control  
- Clean console rendering without iterative row loops

## 📌 Features

✔ Fully recursive top + bottom structure  
✔ Exact centered alignment  
✔ Prints a 21-row diamond pattern  
✔ Clean logic + easy to modify for larger shapes

## 🖥 How to Compile & Run

### On GitHub Codespaces / Linux / Mac:
```bash
g++ diamond.cpp -o diamond && ./diamond
